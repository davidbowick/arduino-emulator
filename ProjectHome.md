# Arduino emulator in Visual Studio #

THIS SITE IS NOT AN OFFICIAL SITE OF ARDUINO'S TEAM.

I created this emulator to help me in learning to use an Arduino board. I shared this emulator to help other people.

I have created a basic emulator for the Arduino boards.
This allows you to debug more easily a program with the Visual Studio debugger.
The GUI part of this emulator is in C #, the reading part of the program is in C++.

I also add an emulator for Lightuino boards.(the one i have)

Remaining work:
  * Models of ATmega (14 or 54 digital io, ...)
  * ~~Analog Inputs simulation~~
  * ~~Analog pin use as digital (digital read or write)~~
  * Advanced I/O (tone, pulse)
  * Random numbers
  * Interrupts
  * Help, start guide
  * Add comments on every functions
  * Implement others Arduino functions
  * ...

Remaining Lightuino work:
  * PWM output
  * Source driver
  * IR
  * Light sensor
  * ...
